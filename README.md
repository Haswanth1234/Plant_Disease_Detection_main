Plant Disease Detection

An AI-powered application that identifies plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning and computer vision. Designed to help farmers, gardeners, and agricultural researchers detect plant health issues earlyâ€”reducing crop losses and improving yield.

Project Overview

Purpose: Upload leaf images, then receive predictions on plant disease status using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN).

Use Case: Early detection helps in timely treatment and prevention, aiding efficient agricultural practices.

Features

User Interface: Built using Flask; users can upload images and view results seamlessly.

CNN Model: Architecture implemented in CNN.py for disease classification.

Backend & Deployment: Includes Procfile for deployment, e.g., on Heroku.

Supplementary Data:

disease_info.csv â€“ disease descriptions.

supplement_info.csv â€“ extended information (e.g., remedies or treatment suggestions).

Sample Images: Located under test_images for quick testing.

Static & Template Assets: Organized under staticFiles/uploads and templates.

Getting Started

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/Haswanth1234/Plant_Disease_Detection_main.git
cd Plant_Disease_Detection_main


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app

python app.py


Access the web interface
Open your browser at http://localhost:5000, upload a leaf image, and get the prediction.

How It Works

Image Upload: Users upload a leaf image via the web interface.

Preprocessing & Prediction: The image is processed and passed through the CNN (CNN.py), generating a disease prediction.

Result Display: The UI shows the predicted disease along with helpful details from the CSV files.

Dataset & Model (Optional)

If the model was trained using public datasets like PlantVillage, you can include details about training methodology and datasets here. If using a custom dataset, explain that instead.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:

Improve model accuracy.

Add more plant species.

Make the UI more responsive.

Optimize deployment â€“ suggest platforms like Heroku, Docker, or AWS.
